This chapter explains how the requirements defined in the RASD map to the design elements (components) defined in chapter 2 of this document. To aid readability, all goals and their requirements are listed again, and then their components are mapped. In this chapter, special attention is given to the server-side modules. We ignore, therefore, the client-side components (not very significant in this project phase). Below are the requirements traceability tables.
