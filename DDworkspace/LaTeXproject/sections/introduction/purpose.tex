It contains the description of the architecture chosen to design the CLup System. Furthermore, it describes how the UI has to look like, and the map from the requirements defined in the RASD and the architectural components defined in this document.
It also includes a set of design characteristics required for the implementations by introducing constraints and quality attributes, and it gives a presentation of the implementation, integration, and testing plan.

DD is addressed to the software development team who will have to implement the described system and it has the purpose to guide them through the development process.
