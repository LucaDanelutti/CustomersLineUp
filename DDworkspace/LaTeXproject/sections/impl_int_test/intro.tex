This chapter explains how to implement, integrate, and test the system designed in this document. We decided to explain this in 3 steps. The first one (\textbf{Implementation, Component Integration and Testing}) talks about how to implement the single component (the order), how to integrate and test them.
The second step (\textbf{System Testing}) explains the plan to test the system implemented. The last step (\textbf{Additional Specification on Testing}) gives additional information to make easier the testing process.
