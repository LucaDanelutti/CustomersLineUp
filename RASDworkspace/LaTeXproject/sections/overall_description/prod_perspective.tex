Here is the application domain model of this project. In particular, this section focuses on the object model (\textbf{static information models} and \textbf{dynamic class behaviour models}).
\subsection{Static Information Model}
The below high-level diagram provides a static information model of the application domain. Basically, it is the structure of the world, it contains only few attributes, and it doesn't include every class that will be necessary to define the model of the CLup system. \newline

\subsection{Dynamic Class Behaviour Models}
The below state diagrams shows some	critical aspects of	the	application, how the behaviour of these critical aspects is modeled and the evolution of their states.
