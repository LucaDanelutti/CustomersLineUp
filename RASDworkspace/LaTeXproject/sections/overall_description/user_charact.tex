The actors of the application are the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Visitor:} a person who can sign up to the CLup service. If the user doesn't have a compatible device to register to CLup he/she can go to the store and line up there.
    \item \textbf{Customer:} a person passed through the registration process. He/she can line up digitally or to book a visit right from the CLup application.
    \item \textbf{Store employee:} a person who works at a grocery store and is registered to CLup as an employee. He/she can line up customers who arrived at the store without lining up digitally. He/she will then call the customers when it's time to enter the supermarket. He is the one who will be in charge of checking the numbers of people entering a queue and checking the booking information of the visiting people.
    \item \textbf{Store manager:} a person who works at a grocery store as the manager of that shop. He/she can manage the store information on the CLup platform like the opening hours or the store capacity. He can monitor customer information recorded by the system.
\end{itemize}
