In the specification document presented by the client we found some points that lacked in precision. In order to better clarify and to make you understand better the content of this document we decided to introduce those assumptions.
\subsection{Text assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Entrances monitoring is referred to customers using their personal QR code.
    \item QR Code scanning is not mandatory: customers who will scan their QR code when entering the store will contribute to entrances monitoring, thoose who will not will not contribute to such statistics.
    \item Previous visits durations are inserted in the CLup system in some way.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Domain assumptions}
