In this section, we include the alloy model of CLup. In this model we want to prove that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A Visitor can line up at the store entry point, he/she will be called by the employee and then he will enter the store showing his/her number
    \item A Customer can line up with the CLup application, he/she will be called and then he/she will enter the store showing his/her number
    \item A Customer can line up with the CLup application and can generate the QRCode, he/she will be called and then he/she will enter the store with the QRCode
    \item A Customer can book a visit and then he/she will enter the store
\end{itemize}
We have chosen these 4 situations because they well represent the core concepts around CLup.
