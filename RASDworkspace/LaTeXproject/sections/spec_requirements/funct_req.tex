\subsection{Use Cases}

    In this section we presents some use cases of CLup System. Use cases diagram is first illustrated to give a general and abstract view of the actors and use cases associated with them (\textit{Section 3.2.3.1}). After that, all use cases illustrated in the diagram are described in their particular (\textit{Section 3.2.3.2}).
    \subsubsection{Use Cases Diagrams}
    To facilitate the readability of the diagram, it is divided into 4 diagrams, each dedicated to a single actor.
