# CLup - Customers Line-up
This project has been developed as final assignment for the Software Engineering II course held by Professor Elisabetta Di Nitto at Politecnico di Milano A.Y. 2020-2021. The highest possible grade has been assigned to this project.

The objective of this project is to apply in practice what we learned during lectures to become familiar with software engineering practices and be able to address new software engineering issues rigorously. The project is divided into three assignments:
1. The definition of a Requirement Analysis and Specification Document (RASD), starting from an informal description of the problem.
2. The definition of the Design Document (DD), regarding the system considered in point 1.

This application has been designed during the COVID-19 pandemic and wants to foster a safe shopping experience by providing a customer flow control system. This system should allow the users to avoid crowds both inside and outside the stores. The system should also be very simple to use (to adapt to all demographics) and provide fallback options for those who do not have access to the application.
